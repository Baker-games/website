          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            We’re a small (but mighty) gaming studio, born from a genuine
            passion for games, technology, and creating fun, memorable
            experiences for players everywhere.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our name comes from the fact that our creator is Portuguese, which
            made people associate him to the idea that he was a baker when he
            was a kid — a job he actually did later on!
          </p>

          <p>
            As time went on, that little baker learned programming and fell in
            love with game development. He cherished the process of modeling and
            crafting worlds, much like he had loved shaping treats in his old
            profession. This passion eventually led to the creation of our
            gaming studio — <strong>yippee!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            And yes… to the left or below (depending on your device), you`ll
            spot our glorious mascot, <strong>Toasty</strong> 🥖.

          <h2>About the Team</h2>
          <p>
            Despite the plural, our “team” is actually a one-man powerhouse.
            Meet <strong>Francisco Nicolau Sargo Froes</strong> — the mind,
            muscle, and motivation behind everything you see here.
          </p>

          <p>
            Francisco holds a degree in Production Engineering from
            <strong>Unicamp</strong>
            and has built his career working with major companies in roles
            spanning
            <strong>Product Management</strong> and
            <strong>Data Engineering</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From time to time the company hires some free lancers that helps us
            build some very nice art. A few notable mentions are:
            <strong>Ian Castanhos and João Vitor</strong>
