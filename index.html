          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            We’re a small (but mighty) gaming studio, born from a genuine
            passion for games, technology, and creating fun, memorable
            experiences for players everywhere.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our name comes from the fact that our creator is Portuguese, which
            made people associate him to the idea that he was a baker when he
            was a kid — a job he actually did later on!
          </p>

          <p>
            As time went on, that little baker learned programming and fell in
            love with game development. He cherished the process of modeling and
            crafting worlds, much like he had loved shaping treats in his old
            profession. This passion eventually led to the creation of our
            gaming studio — <strong>yippee!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            And yes… to the left or below (depending on your device), you`ll
            spot our glorious mascot, <strong>Toasty</strong> 🥖.

          <p>
            Although we say “team,” the real driving force behind everything
            here is just one person:
            <strong>Francisco Nicolau Sargo Froes</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Francisco holds a degree in Production Engineering from
            <strong>Unicamp</strong>, a Master`s degree from
            <strong>USP</strong>, and has built his career working with leading
            companies in roles across <strong>Product Management</strong> and
            <strong>Data Science</strong>. He combines analytical thinking with
            creativity and a genuine passion for building meaningful projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Along the way, we`re fortunate to collaborate with talented
            freelancers who help bring our ideas to life. Special thanks to
            <strong>Ian Castanhos</strong> and <strong>João Vitor</strong>,
            whose artistic contributions always elevate our work.
